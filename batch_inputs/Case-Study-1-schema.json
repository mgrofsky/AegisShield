    "app_input": "The system is a voice-based application with IoT integration, designed to facilitate user interactions through voice commands. The primary components of the system include:\n\n- **User**: The individual who provides voice commands and receives audio responses.\n- **Microphone**: Captures the user's voice commands, converting them into audio signals.\n- **Speaker**: Outputs the audio responses generated by the system back to the user.\n- **Client-side Application**: This component is responsible for converting the captured voice commands into audio signals, which are then sent to the server for processing. The client-side application also receives responses from the server and can send control requests to an IoT controller.\n- **Server-side Application**: Processes the audio signals received from the client-side application. Based on the input, the server generates appropriate responses, which can either be sent back to the client or used to perform actions within the system, such as managing access controls or interacting with IoT devices.\n- **Cloud Services**: An optional component within the architecture, used for storing information or providing additional services that complement the core functionality of the voice-based application.\n- **IoT Controller**: Receives control requests from the client-side application and manages IoT devices accordingly. This controller is responsible for executing commands that result in physical actions, such as opening a door or controlling other connected devices.\n- **IoT Devices**: These are the physical devices that carry out actions based on the commands received from the IoT controller. They interact with the environment according to the instructions provided by the system.\n\nThe system allows users to interact with it through voice commands, leading to various outcomes such as audio responses, actions by IoT devices, or adjustments in access permissions. The architecture supports communication between all components to ensure seamless functionality and user experience. The overall design is intended to integrate voice command processing with IoT capabilities, making it a versatile tool for controlling and managing connected devices through voice interactions.",
