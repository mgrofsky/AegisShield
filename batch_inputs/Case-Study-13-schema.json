    "app_input": "The system comprises several widely used end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging applications, including Signal, WhatsApp, Viber, Wickr Me, Element, and Telegram. These applications provide secure communication by encrypting messages from the sender to the recipient, ensuring that no third party, including the service provider, can access the content.\n\nKey components and features of the system include:\n\n- **Primary Device (Mobile Application)**: The main platform where users initially set up their accounts, generate identity keys, and manage their messaging activities. This device is crucial for establishing the root of trust for secure communications.\n\n- **Companion Devices (Desktop Clients)**: Linked to the primary device, these desktop clients allow users to access their messaging accounts from multiple devices. Each desktop client generates its own identity key, authenticated by the primary device, and can operate independently once linked.\n\n- **Encryption Protocols**: The applications use a variety of cryptographic protocols, including the Signal Protocol for most apps, which employs double ratcheting for forward and backward secrecy, and other custom protocols for apps like Telegram.\n\n- **Data Storage and Management**: SQLite databases are used by some applications, such as Signal, to store authentication credentials, received messages, and pre-keys. These databases are typically encrypted but may be vulnerable to certain types of attacks if not adequately protected.\n\n- **Security Assumptions and Trust Boundaries**: The system assumes that users can protect the private components of their identity keys, with the desktop clients extending the trust boundaries to include these additional devices. The document highlights the challenges posed by adversarial access to these devices, which can lead to security breaches if the threat models are not adequately evolved.",
