    "app_input": "The system under threat modeling is an Ambient Intelligence (AmI) system, which is a type of IoT application designed to create intelligent and contextually aware environments.\n\n**Key components of the system include:**\n\n- **Sensors:** Integrated into the environment to capture data such as motion, temperature, light levels, and biometric data. These sensors provide real-time information crucial for making decisions and adapting the environment to user needs.\n\n- **Actuators:** Devices that perform physical actions based on system decisions or user interactions. Examples include smart lighting systems, smart thermostats, automated door locks, and robotic arms.\n\n- **Data Repositories:** Databases and cloud storage used to store collected data, user profiles, and system configurations. This data is essential for historical analysis, learning, and providing personalized services.\n\n- **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Models:** These models analyze collected data, learn from user interactions, and make intelligent decisions to tailor the environment to individual needs and preferences.\n\n- **Communication Infrastructure:** Comprising wired and wireless networks, routers, gateways, and access points, this infrastructure enables seamless data exchange and coordination among various components within the intelligent environment.\n\n- **User Devices:** Devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and wearable devices that allow users to interact with the AmI system. These devices serve as interfaces for controlling and monitoring the smart environment.\n\nThe Ambient Intelligence system operates in environments like smart homes, offices, and healthcare facilities. It aims to optimize energy usage, enhance security, and improve overall user comfort by adapting to user preferences and environmental changes in real time.",
