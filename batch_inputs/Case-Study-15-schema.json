    "app_input": "The system is a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) designed to optimize and monitor window cleaning operations. This system integrates Internet of Things (IoT) devices with cloud-based services to provide real-time data exchange and operational efficiency.\n\n- **Key components of the system include:**\n\n- **IoT Hardware:** The system utilizes Arduino microcontrollers equipped with various sensors, including Hall Effect sensors for monitoring water flow, temperature sensors, GPS for location tracking, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for communication with mobile devices.\n\n- **Mobile Application:** Developed using Flutter, the mobile application allows operators to monitor and control the IoT hardware remotely. It connects to the IoT devices via BLE and forwards real-time data to cloud-based endpoints.\n\n- **Cloud Services:** The system uses Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services, particularly Google Firestore, a NoSQL database, to store and manage real-time data. Firebase Authentication is employed to secure access to this data, ensuring that only authorized users can create, read, update, or delete data.\n\n- **Data Communication:** The system supports multiple communication protocols, including HTTP POST requests for sending data to API gateways, and BLE for local communication with the IoT hardware.\n\n- **External Dependencies:** The system relies on external services such as Shopify for targeted advertisements based on data analytics, and various Python libraries for handling data communication and storage.\n\n- **Additional Assets:** The system includes water purification components in the vans, actuators to control water flow, and a digital supply chain infrastructure that processes and commercializes data related to resource usage and route optimization.",
