    "app_input": "The system is a Vehicular Fog Computing (VFC) system designed to manage and process data generated by connected vehicles. The VFC architecture integrates an intermediate layer of fog nodes between smart vehicles and centralized cloud services, facilitating low-latency services and real-time processing required by vehicular applications. The system is structured as follows:\n\n- **Smart Vehicles**: These edge devices are equipped with sensors and computing capabilities to perceive their environment and interact with the VFC system. They generate and exchange data related to road conditions, vehicle status, and other relevant information.\n\n- **Fog Nodes**: Positioned near roads, such as on traffic lights or roadside units (RSUs), these nodes act as intermediaries between smart vehicles and cloud services. They handle local processing, decision-making, and data storage to reduce latency and improve efficiency within the VFC system. Fog nodes are responsible for processing and aggregating data from vehicles, sending alerts, and managing traffic flow.\n\n- **Cloud Services**: Centralized servers that perform large-scale data analysis, manage data storage, and provide computational resources for tasks that cannot be handled locally by the fog nodes. The cloud layer is responsible for long-term data storage, extensive data analytics, and supporting advanced applications such as predictive maintenance and traffic optimization.\n\n- **Roadside Units (RSUs)**: Specialized fog nodes that collect data from vehicles and other sensors in the road infrastructure. They play a critical role in real-time traffic management by processing local data and making decisions that impact nearby vehicles, such as traffic light scheduling and alert dissemination.\n\n- **Data Flows**: Data flows within the VFC system occur between smart vehicles, fog nodes, and cloud services. The DFD categorizes these data flows into three main groups: Edge-Fog data flows (between vehicles and fog nodes), Fog-Cloud data flows (between fog nodes and cloud services), and external data flows (interactions with entities outside the VFC system).",
