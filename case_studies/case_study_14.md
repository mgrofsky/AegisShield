## **Description of the Application/System Being Threat Modeled**

The system is a **Drone as a Service (DaaS) platform**, which **provides drone-based services** for various sectors including **emergency response, public safety, and logistics**. The **DaaS platform leverages Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)** equipped with **advanced technologies such as sensors, cameras, GPS, and communication modules**.

### **Key Components:**

- **Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs):** These drones are the **primary devices used for various missions**, equipped with **embedded systems and firmware** to control their operations. They may perform tasks such as **surveillance, delivery, and data collection**.
- **Firmware and Embedded Systems:** The drones operate using **firmware that manages their hardware components** and ensures proper functionality. **Firmware security is critical**, as vulnerabilities in the software could expose the drones to **remote hijacking or data tampering**.
- **Ground Control Station (GCS):** This is the **central hub for managing and controlling the drones**. Operators can **monitor drone activities, issue commands, and manage data collected by the drones** through the **GCS**. It is connected to the **drones via secure communication channels**.
- **Cloud Services:** The **DaaS platform utilizes cloud-based services** for **data storage, processing, and analysis**. The cloud infrastructure supports **functions such as long-term data storage, large-scale analytics, and coordination between multiple drones and ground stations**.
- **Data Communication:** The system **relies on secure communication protocols** to **transmit data between drones, the GCS, and cloud services**. The **integrity and security of these communication channels are crucial** to prevent **interception and tampering of critical data**.

The **DaaS platform** is designed to **offer flexible and scalable drone services** across various sectors. It incorporates **multiple layers of technology**, including **UAV hardware, embedded systems, cloud infrastructure, and secure communication protocols**, to **deliver reliable and efficient services**.
