## **Description of the Application/System Being Threat Modeled**

The system being threat-modeled is a **Visual Sensor Network (VSN)**, which is a specialized type of sensor network designed for capturing, processing, and transmitting **visual data** (images/videos) across a **distributed network of camera nodes**.

### **Key Components:**

- **Visual Sensor Nodes**: The core elements of the network, equipped with cameras and necessary hardware. Each node captures **visual data**, processes it locally, and communicates with other nodes. The visual sensors are connected to computing devices that typically run **Linux** as their operating system, managing hardware resources and providing a platform for business applications.
- **Operating System**: The nodes operate on a **Linux-based system**, which abstracts the hardware and supports applications running on it. The OS manages **visual sensors** and connected devices.
- **Business Application**: Handles tasks like **image processing, object detection, and data aggregation**. May utilize additional hardware resources like **embedded GPUs** to enhance processing capabilities.
- **Middleware**: Uses **MQTT or ROS** for **distributed processing**, enabling communication between nodes for data sharing and coordination.
- **Network Infrastructure**: Includes **wired and wireless connections**, crucial for **visual data transmission and distributed processing**.
- **External Interfaces**: May include **internet connectivity**, allowing **remote monitoring, data storage, and integration with broader IoT systems**.

The **VSN operates in a distributed manner**, with each node processing **visual data locally or transmitting it to others** for further analysis. The system supports **autonomous operation**, where nodes communicate **without centralized control**, making VSNs suitable for **surveillance, environmental monitoring, industrial automation**, and similar applications.

| **Criteria** | **Score** | **Justification** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Application/System DFD** | ðŸ”´ **1** | There is **no Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** provided in the paper, which limits the systemâ€™s representation for analysis. |
| **Application Type** | ðŸŸ¢ **5** | The application is explicitly identified as an **IoT Application**, specifically focused on a **Visual Sensor Network (VSN)**. |
| **Industry Sector** | ðŸŸ¡ **3** | The industry sector is **inferred as Information Technology**, based on the **focus on VSNs for surveillance and industrial monitoring**, though **not explicitly stated**. |
| **Data Sensitivity** | ðŸŸ¡ **5** | **High data sensitivity inferred**, from the discussion on **privacy concerns and the sensitive nature of visual data**. |
| **Internet Facing** | ðŸŸ¡ **5** | The system is **internet-facing**, with discussions on **external interfaces and potential internet connections** clearly described. |
| **Compliance Requirements** | ðŸ”´ **1** | **No compliance requirements** mentioned, leaving a gap in the evaluation of **regulatory standards**. |
| **Authentication Methods** | ðŸ”´ **1** | **No authentication methods specified**, a notable omission given the **security focus of the paper**. |
| **Technical Details** | ðŸŸ¡ **2** | **Linux-based systems mentioned** for nodes, but **specific versions, databases, and programming languages** are missing. |
| **Threat Details** | ðŸŸ¢ **5** | **Threats are well-defined and categorized using the STRIDE framework**, with **a comprehensive explanation of risks**, making the **threat analysis robust**. |
