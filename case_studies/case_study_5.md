## **Description of the Application/System Being Threat Modeled**

The system under threat modeling is a **Distributed Control System (DCS)** within an **oil refinery**. The **DCS is a critical component** of the refinery's **operational technology (OT)** and is responsible for **centrally collecting information from multiple sensors**, **analyzing this data**, and **sending necessary commands to actuators** to adjust the values. The system's **primary objective** is to **maintain an optimal operating environment within the refinery**.

### **Key Components:**

- **DCS Controller:** Centralizes **process control functions** and **communicates with sensors and actuators** to manage the refinery's operations.
- **DCS Servers:** Provide **screen values and user profile information** to **operator and engineering workstations (OWS and EWS)**.
- **Engineering Workstation (EWS):** Used by **engineers to manage controller settings and configurations** within the DCS.
- **Operator Workstation (OWS):** Used by **operators to monitor and adjust process set-point values**.
- **Active Directory (AD):** Provides **centralized user account management and authentication** within the DCS environment.
- **GPS Server:** Provides **time synchronization** within the **DCS network**.
- **Historian:** Stores **process and operational data for trend analysis**, which is **crucial for monitoring and improving refinery operations**.
- **Safety Instrumented System (SIS):** Although **not the primary focus** of this threat model, the **SIS works in conjunction with the DCS** to **ensure fail-safe operation against dangerous conditions**.

The system operates in an **isolated network**, interacting with **various components within a production process**. However, due to the **increased connectivity with corporate networks and the internet**, the system is **exposed to cybersecurity risks**. The DCS is **designed to prioritize the CIA triadâ€”Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**, with a **particular emphasis on maintaining availability** to ensure **continuous operations in the refinery environment**.
