## **Description of the Application/System Being Threat Modeled**

The system is a **Vehicular Fog Computing (VFC) system** designed to **manage and process data generated by connected vehicles**. The **VFC architecture integrates an intermediate layer of fog nodes between smart vehicles and centralized cloud services**, facilitating **low-latency services and real-time processing required by vehicular applications**. The system is structured as follows:

- **Smart Vehicles:** These **edge devices** are equipped with **sensors and computing capabilities** to **perceive their environment and interact with the VFC system**. They generate and exchange **data related to road conditions, vehicle status, and other relevant information**.
- **Fog Nodes:** Positioned **near roads**, such as on **traffic lights or roadside units (RSUs)**, these nodes act as **intermediaries between smart vehicles and cloud services**. They handle **local processing, decision-making, and data storage** to **reduce latency and improve efficiency** within the VFC system. Fog nodes **process and aggregate data from vehicles**, **send alerts**, and **manage traffic flow**.
- **Cloud Services:** **Centralized servers** that perform **large-scale data analysis**, **manage data storage**, and provide **computational resources** for tasks that **cannot be handled locally by the fog nodes**. The cloud layer is responsible for **long-term data storage, extensive data analytics, and supporting advanced applications such as predictive maintenance and traffic optimization**.
- **Roadside Units (RSUs):** **Specialized fog nodes** that **collect data from vehicles and other sensors** in the road infrastructure. They play a **critical role in real-time traffic management** by **processing local data and making decisions** that impact nearby vehicles, such as **traffic light scheduling and alert dissemination**.
- **Data Flows:** **Data flows within the VFC system occur between smart vehicles, fog nodes, and cloud services**. The DFD categorizes these data flows into **three main groups**: **Edge-Fog data flows** (between vehicles and fog nodes), **Fog-Cloud data flows** (between fog nodes and cloud services), and **external data flows** (interactions with entities outside the VFC system).

The **VFC system** is designed to **enhance the safety, efficiency, and reliability of vehicular operations** by providing **real-time processing and decision-making capabilities close to the vehicles themselves**. This architecture allows for **reduced latency, improved data management, and the potential to support advanced vehicular applications, such as autonomous driving and smart traffic management**.
