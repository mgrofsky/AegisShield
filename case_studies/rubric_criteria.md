# Rubric Criteria

## **Rubric for Evaluating the Case Study Inputs**

| **Criteria** | **5 Points** | **4 Points** | **3 Points** | **2 Points** | **1 Point** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Application/System Description** | A thorough, clear, and detailed description of the application/system, including its purpose, functionality, architecture, and key components. Enables a complete understanding of system operation. | A clear and detailed description, possibly lacking depth in certain areas or omitting minor components. Provides solid understanding and requires minimal clarification. | A general description covering the main aspects but lacking detail and specificity. Important components or functionalities may not be fully explained. | A vague or incomplete description, missing significant information about the purpose, functionality, or architecture. Requires substantial inference or additional research. | Little to no description provided, or too vague to understand the system. Critical details are absent, hindering effective analysis. |
| **2. Application Type** | Explicitly stated and precisely categorized (e.g., "Cyber-Physical System for Industrial Automation"). Aids targeted analysis. | Explicitly stated but lacks precise categorization. Described in general terms. | Can be inferred with reasonable confidence but is not explicitly stated. Inference guides analysis but lacks confirmation. | Ambiguous or vaguely referenced, making it difficult to determine the exact nature of the application. Hampers targeted threat modeling. | Not mentioned or cannot be reasonably inferred. Prevents the application of specific threat modeling techniques. |
| **3. Industry Sector** | Explicitly stated and relevant, with detailed context (e.g., "Healthcare sector focusing on medical device integration"). Enhances the relevance of compliance and threat considerations. | Explicitly stated but lacks additional context or specificity. Indicates the general industry without sub-sector details. | Can be inferred but is not explicitly mentioned. Inference is sufficient for general analysis but may lack precision. | Ambiguous or vaguely referenced, challenging the alignment of threats and compliance requirements. | Not mentioned or cannot be reasonably inferred. Limits the consideration of industry-specific threats and regulations. |
| **4. Data Sensitivity** | Explicitly described, including the types of data handled and any classification levels (e.g., PII, PHI). Informs threat modeling significantly. | Explicitly mentioned but lacks detailed classification. Types of data identified without specific sensitivity levels. | Can be inferred based on the context but is not explicitly described. | Vaguely mentioned without clear details. Limits the accurate assessment of data-related threats. | Not mentioned or cannot be reasonably inferred. Challenges the prioritization of data confidentiality, integrity, and availability threats. |
| **5. Internet Facing Status** | Clearly stated, including the implications and potential exposure risks. Critical for understanding external threat vectors. | Mentioned but lacks detailed context or implications. Clear exposure status with minimal discussion on risks. | Can be inferred from the description but is not explicitly stated. Inference allows general threat considerations. | Ambiguous or vaguely referenced, making accurate assessment of external threats difficult. | Not mentioned or cannot be determined. Hinders the identification of network exposure threats. |
| **6. Compliance Requirements** | Explicitly stated, detailing the applicable laws, regulations, and standards (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) and their influence on the system design. Ensures thorough consideration of compliance-related threats. | Mentioned but lacks detailed discussion or specific standards. Acknowledgment without in-depth analysis. | Can be strongly inferred based on the industry and data but not explicitly mentioned. Allows the consideration of general compliance requirements. | Vaguely referenced without specifics. Limits the assessment of compliance-related threats. | Not mentioned or stated as not applicable. May overlook critical regulatory obligations and associated threats. |
| **7. Authentication Methods** | Detailed information provided on the authentication methods and access controls, including protocols, technologies, and multi-factor mechanisms. Aids in assessing authentication-related threats. | Mentioned with some details but lacks full specificity. | Mentioned but are generic (e.g., "uses passwords") without implementation details. | Vaguely referenced or can be inferred, such as "secure login," without additional information. | Not mentioned. Impedes the identification of unauthorized access threats. |
| **8. Technical Details (Database, OS, Languages, Frameworks)** | Comprehensive technical details, including specific technologies and versions for databases, operating systems, programming languages, and frameworks. Crucial for identifying technology-specific threats. | Provided but may lack version information or completeness in one area. | Mentioned but are generic or incomplete in multiple areas. | Vaguely referenced with minimal detail. | Not mentioned. Challenges the assessment of technology-specific threats. |
| **9. Threat Details** | Well-defined, clearly organized by type, and presented in a structured format (e.g., tables or bullet points). Descriptions are detailed; acronyms are minimal or explained. Facilitates effective analysis. | Defined and organized but may lack some detail or have unexplained acronyms. Overall organization aids understanding with minor clarification needed. | Identifiable but not well-organized. Descriptions may be brief or lack clarity. Usable but may require additional effort to interpret DFD content from the paper. | Hard to find, scattered in text, or lacking adequate definitions. Disorganization hinders coherent threat analysis. | Not clearly identified or absent. Impossible to assess or model potential security issues effectively. |
