## **Description of the Application/System Being Threat Modeled**

The system under consideration is a **contact tracing application** used to **monitor and control the spread of COVID-19** by **tracking users' interactions and proximity to one another**. The **architecture of the system** is presented in **both centralized and decentralized forms**:

- **Centralized Architecture:** In this setup, **users must register with a central server**, which **generates temporary IDs** for each device. These **IDs are exchanged between devices** when they come into contact. If a **user tests positive for COVID-19**, the collected **data, including the temporary IDs, is sent to the central server**, which then **maps the contacts and notifies other users** who may have been exposed.
- **Decentralized Architecture:** In this architecture, most of the **data processing occurs on the user's device**. The **application generates rolling keys locally** on each device, which are **exchanged with other devices** during interactions. If a **user tests positive**, the **rolling keys are uploaded to the server**, where **other users can download and compare them with their stored keys to determine potential exposure**.

### **Key Components:**

- **User Devices:** **Smartphones or tablets** equipped with the **contact tracing app**. These devices utilize **Bluetooth and/or GPS** to **monitor and record close contacts** with other users.
- **User Credentials:** Data related to **user registration and login**, including **usernames, passwords, and phone numbers**, when required by the application.
- **Device Credentials:** Information about the user's device, such as **IMEI, identification keys, and IP addresses**.
- **Mobile Application:** The **client-side application** installed on **user devices**. This application **manages the collection, storage, and processing of proximity data** and provides **alerts to users regarding potential exposure**.
- **Data in Application:** The application **stores data locally**, including **encryption keys, proximity values, and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data**.
- **Central Server (for Centralized Architecture):** The server **responsible for generating temporary IDs**, collecting **data from user devices**, **processing that data to identify potential exposures**, and **notifying users** who may have been in contact with an infected individual.
- **Data Storage:** **Data centers or cloud storage facilities** used for **storing, processing, and managing** the data collected by the application.
- **Patient Data:** Information about **users who have tested positive for COVID-19**, including potentially **sensitive data** such as **phone numbers, duration of illness, and geographical location**.
- **Service Server (for Decentralized Architecture):** Handles the **management of rolling keys** and facilitates the **comparison of keys to identify potential exposures**.
- **Log Files:** Contain **timestamps, device configurations, and other metadata** related to the **operation of the application**.

The system is **designed to operate in a networked environment**, where **data flows between user devices, central servers, and potentially other external systems**.
