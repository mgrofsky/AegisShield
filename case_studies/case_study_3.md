## **Description of the Application/System Being Threat Modeled**

The system being threat-modeled is a **5G core slicing implementation** within a telecommunications network. This system enables network operators to create **isolated, virtualized segments (or slices) of the 5G network**, each tailored to specific use cases, such as **enhanced mobile broadband, massive machine-type communications, and ultra-reliable, low-latency communications**.

### **Key Components:**

- **Network Slices:** Independent virtual segments within the 5G network, each optimized for different performance and functional requirements. These slices operate in isolation, ensuring that each slice meets the specific needs of its use case without impacting others.
- **Network Functions (NFs):** Virtualized components that perform specific tasks within the 5G core network, including both **user plane and control plane functions**. These functions are integral to the operation of each network slice.
- **Virtual Network Functions (VNFs):** These are **virtualized instances of network functions** that operate on hypervisors or within containers, forming the backbone of each network slice. VNFs are dynamically managed and allocated based on the needs of the network slices.
- **Trust Boundaries:** The system includes **multiple trust boundaries**, which are critical for maintaining security and privacy in a **multi-tenant environment**. These boundaries distinguish between trusted and untrusted zones within the network infrastructure, particularly where data crosses from one administrative domain to another.
- **Orchestration and Management:** Managed by the **Network Functions Virtualization Orchestrator (NFVO)** and related entities, these components **control the lifecycle, deployment, and resource allocation of network slices**. The NFVO ensures that each slice is instantiated, configured, and managed according to its specific requirements.
- **Edge and Cloud Computing:** The system incorporates **both edge and cloud computing nodes** to optimize **resource allocation and processing capabilities**. This allows for **efficient management of latency-sensitive applications** and **scalable network resources**.
- **External Interfaces:** These include **connections to external networks, partners, and service providers**, enabling the 5G network to extend its capabilities and services beyond the traditional infrastructure. These interfaces are essential for the **dynamic and flexible nature of 5G slicing**.

The **5G core slicing system** operates in a highly **virtualized and dynamic environment**, allowing for **flexible resource allocation across multiple domains and service providers**. The architecture is designed to support **various 5G use cases**, ensuring **high levels of performance, security, and scalability**.
