## **Description of the Application/System Being Threat Modeled**

The system being threat modeled is the **Open Energy Monitor (OEM) system**, an **open-source platform for home automation and energy monitoring**. The OEM system is designed to **monitor and control various home appliances and energy usage**, with a particular focus on the **MQTT protocol for communication between IoT devices**.

### **Key Components:**

- **emonPi and emonBase:** These are **base stations** that **collect data from other devices in the system**. They act as **central hubs for data collection, processing, and storage** within the OEM system.
- **EmonTh and emonTx:** These **modules measure environmental conditions** such as **temperature and humidity**, as well as **monitor power consumption and production within the home**.
- **WiFi MQTT Relay:** A **general-purpose relay controlled remotely via the MQTT protocol**, used to **manage various devices within the home automation system**.
- **MQTT Broker and Clients:** The **MQTT protocol facilitates communication between devices**. The **MQTT broker manages message distribution** among clients, and the system **relies heavily on this protocol for device communication**.
- **EmonCMS Web Application:** A **web-based interface** that allows **users to visualize the data collected by the OEM system**. It provides **insights into energy usage, environmental conditions, and system performance**, enabling users to **monitor and control their home automation setup**.

The system operates in a **connected environment**, where **data flows between sensors, base stations, and cloud storage**, enabling **remote monitoring and control of home energy systems**.
