## **Description of the Application/System Being Threat Modeled**

The system under consideration is an **AI/ML-based predictive maintenance architecture** used within the **renewable energy sector**, specifically for **solar energy management**. The **architecture integrates AI/ML models** to **predict hardware failures and optimize power flow** in a **solar energy grid**. This system is part of the **LIGHT-TOREADOR infrastructure** and is aimed at **maximizing the efficiency of solar energy production**.

### **Key Components:**

- **Sensors:** Deployed at **power station sites**, these sensors monitor various parameters such as **power, voltage, current, frequency, and energy (both active and reactive)**. The data collected by these sensors is crucial for **both predictive maintenance and power flow optimization**.
- **Data Logger:** A **local device at the power station** that collects data from the **sensors**. It is equipped with a **network communication interface** and has a **local root-of-trust**, ensuring **data integrity before forwarding it to the central system**.
- **Receiver:** Part of the **LIGHT ICT infrastructure**, this component **receives data from the Data Logger** and prepares it for **further processing**.
- **Anonymity (Anon) Agent:** A component that **retrieves the sensor data and performs pre-processing tasks such as metadata removal**. This step ensures that the **data is anonymized before it is used for model training or predictions**.
- **TOREADOR Platform:** A **cloud-based environment** where the **pre-processed data** is stored and used for **training and validating AI/ML models**. This platform is **central to the predictive maintenance and power optimization functions of the system**.
- **ML Models:** The **AI/ML models** are trained and validated within the **TOREADOR platform** using the **pre-processed data**. These models are then **deployed to predict hardware failures and optimize power flow in real-time**.
- **Dashboard:** An interface within the **LIGHT platform** where **employees can log in to view the predictions generated by the AI/ML models**. This dashboard provides **insights into the operational status of the solar energy grid** and allows for **proactive maintenance decisions**.
- **Metadata:** In addition to **sensor data**, the system also manages **metadata related to the solar power plants**, including **location, operational status, and ownership details**. This metadata is **critical for contextualizing the sensor data** and **ensuring accurate predictions**.

The system **operates in a connected environment**, with **data flowing from the sensors to the AI/ML models** and back to the **operational dashboards**. This architecture **allows for continuous monitoring and optimization of the solar energy grid**, improving **both efficiency and reliability**.
