## **Description of the Application/System Being Threat Modeled**

The system is a **voice-based application with IoT integration**, designed to facilitate user interactions through **voice commands**.

### **Key Components:**

- **User**: The individual who provides voice commands and receives audio responses.
- **Microphone**: Captures the user's voice commands, converting them into audio signals.
- **Speaker**: Outputs the audio responses generated by the system back to the user.
- **Client-side Application**: Converts the captured voice commands into audio signals, sends them to the server for processing, and also receives responses from the server. It can send control requests to an IoT controller.
- **Server-side Application**: Processes the audio signals received from the client-side application. The server generates responses, either sending them back to the client or using them to perform actions like managing access controls or interacting with IoT devices.
- **Cloud Services**: An optional component used for **storing information** or providing **additional services** that support the voice-based application.
- **IoT Controller**: Receives **control requests** from the client-side application and manages IoT devices accordingly, executing commands like opening a door or controlling other connected devices.
- **IoT Devices**: Physical devices that **execute actions based on commands** received from the IoT controller. They interact with the environment as per system instructions.

The system allows users to interact via **voice commands**, triggering **audio responses, IoT device actions, or access permission adjustments**. The architecture ensures **seamless communication** between all components for optimized user experience.
