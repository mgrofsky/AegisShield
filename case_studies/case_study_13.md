## **Description of the Application/System Being Threat Modeled**

The system comprises several **widely used end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging applications**, including **Signal, WhatsApp, Viber, Wickr Me, Element, and Telegram**. These applications provide **secure communication by encrypting messages from the sender to the recipient**, ensuring that **no third party, including the service provider, can access the content**.

### **Key Components and Features:**

- **Primary Device (Mobile Application):** The main platform where **users initially set up their accounts, generate identity keys, and manage their messaging activities**. This device is **crucial for establishing the root of trust for secure communications**.
- **Companion Devices (Desktop Clients):** Linked to the **primary device**, these **desktop clients allow users to access their messaging accounts from multiple devices**. Each desktop client **generates its own identity key, authenticated by the primary device**, and can operate independently once linked.
- **Encryption Protocols:** The applications use a variety of **cryptographic protocols**, including the **Signal Protocol** for most apps, which employs **double ratcheting for forward and backward secrecy**, and other **custom protocols for apps like Telegram**.
- **Data Storage and Management:** **SQLite databases** are used by some applications, such as **Signal**, to **store authentication credentials, received messages, and pre-keys**. These databases are **typically encrypted** but may be **vulnerable to certain types of attacks if not adequately protected**.
- **Security Assumptions and Trust Boundaries:** The system **assumes that users can protect the private components of their identity keys**, with **the desktop clients extending the trust boundaries to include these additional devices**. The document **highlights the challenges posed by adversarial access to these devices**, which can **lead to security breaches if the threat models are not adequately evolved**.
