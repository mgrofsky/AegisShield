## **Description of the Application/System Being Threat Modeled**

The system under threat modeling is an **Ambient Intelligence (AmI) system**, which is a **type of IoT application** designed to create **intelligent and contextually aware environments**. The key components of this system include:

- **Sensors:** Integrated into the environment to **capture data such as motion, temperature, light levels, and biometric data**. These sensors provide **real-time information** crucial for **making decisions and adapting the environment to user needs**.
- **Actuators:** Devices that **perform physical actions** based on **system decisions or user interactions**. Examples include **smart lighting systems, smart thermostats, automated door locks, and robotic arms**.
- **Data Repositories:** **Databases and cloud storage** used to **store collected data, user profiles, and system configurations**. This data is **essential for historical analysis, learning, and providing personalized services**.
- **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Models:** These models **analyze collected data, learn from user interactions, and make intelligent decisions** to **tailor the environment to individual needs and preferences**.
- **Communication Infrastructure:** Comprising **wired and wireless networks, routers, gateways, and access points**, this infrastructure enables **seamless data exchange and coordination** among various components within the **intelligent environment**.
- **User Devices:** Devices such as **smartphones, tablets, laptops, and wearable devices** that **allow users to interact with the AmI system**. These devices serve as **interfaces for controlling and monitoring the smart environment**.

The **Ambient Intelligence system** operates in **environments like smart homes, offices, and healthcare facilities**. It aims to **optimize energy usage, enhance security, and improve overall user comfort** by **adapting to user preferences and environmental changes in real time**.
